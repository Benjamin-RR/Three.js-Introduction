# Three.js-Introduction

### Summary of this Repo
This repository is simply my first experimentations of Three.js to help introduce myself (Or anyone else who is interested) to the possibilities of Three.js.

### What is Three.js?
Three.js is a cross-browser JavaScript library and application programming interface used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser using WebGL. The source code is hosted in a repository on GitHub.

### Try it yourself

Pull up terminal from VSCode and go to dir cd client, then run script: 'yarn start'

### Why Three.js?

You can build websites with 3d objects very easily using Three.js combine with other packages such as "react-three-fiber" which is a React component that renders three.js objects in your SPA on React. (If you would like to try this simply install it: npm install three @react-three/fiber)

Additionally if can use your own made 3d objects made and designed in Blender, saving it as a gltf file. Or used pre-existing 3d objects. Many resources exist for this, for example https://poly.pizza/.
